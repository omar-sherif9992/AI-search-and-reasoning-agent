## AI-search-and-reasoning-agent

##### Descritption
The project AI-search-and-reasoning-agent aims to develop an intelligent agent that can perform search and reasoning tasks efficiently. The first milestone of the project focuses on implementing Graph Search Algorithms using Java. These algorithms, such as depth-first search and breadth-first search, will enable the agent to navigate through a graph or network efficiently, finding the shortest paths or identifying important nodes. The agent will be able to handle various types of graphs and effectively solve problems that require search capabilities. The second milestone of the project revolves around the implementation of logic-based agents using Prolog. Prolog, a declarative programming language, allows for logical reasoning and inference capabilities. By utilizing Prolog, the agent will be able to apply logic rules to deduce conclusions and solve problems based on a given knowledge base. This milestone will enhance the agent's reasoning abilities and enable it to handle complex logical reasoning tasks effectively. Overall, these two milestones contribute to the development of a versatile and intelligent search and reasoning agent capable of navigating graphs and employing logical reasoning to solve problems.
